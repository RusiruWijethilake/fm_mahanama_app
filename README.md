## FAQ

#### Why Open Source?

FM Mahanama mobile app was only available on Google PlayStore at the begining. However, due to some issues faced by the developer, Rusiru Wijethilake decided to make the application available open source and removed from PlayStore.

#### What will happen to the older Android app?

Unfortunately the older applications are now unsupported and will not be updated anymore. It is better to uninstall the old application and install the new open-source application which will be available for download via the GitHub project releases.

#### Can I use this code for my own? (Forks)

Yes, you can make a fork or download and use the code for your projects. But when you do please concider the licensing information. However, the source code doesn't includes the Firebase and other required configuration files because security concerns. Currently, developer doesn't share or give access to those configurations.
