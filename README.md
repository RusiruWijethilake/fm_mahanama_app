## FAQ ü§î

#### Q: Why Open Source?

A: FM Mahanama mobile app was only available on Google PlayStore at the begining. However, due to some issues faced by the developer, Rusiru Wijethilake decided to make the application available open source and removed from PlayStore.

#### Q: What will happen to the older Android app?

A:Unfortunately the older applications are now unsupported and will not be updated anymore. It is better to uninstall the old application and install the new open-source application which will be available for download via the GitHub project releases.

#### Q: Can I use this code for my own? (Forks)

A: Yes, you can make a fork or download and use the code for your projects. But when you do please concider the licensing information. Please consider the legal aspect when using the brand name FM Mahanama which is owned by Radio Club of Mahanama College. Also, please do not copy the firebase configuration as it will not work in any other project.

#### Q: Can I host or distribute releases of FM Mahanama mobile or web app on my own?

A: No you can't. App releases will only be available on this git repository's release channel and in app updates will be only taken from the release channel. App will contain hash checkers to verify whether it is from a official distribution network.

Current distribution networks as follows,

* Git repository release channel
* ~~APKMirror (After the initial release)~~
